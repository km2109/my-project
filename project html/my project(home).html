            We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a little
            depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.

        <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary
            with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans
            must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot
            water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.
        </p>
        <p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or
            already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and
            lengthen its shelf life.</p>
